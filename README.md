1. Register User Screen with API Task

In this register user screen, you will only have two input, an email and a password.  you should also have a logo of the company, you can take Orchtech logo and the title of the page which is "Register New User".  This task is to test the interface and the API integration.  The page should be responsive and the only validation required is SMTP domain existance.  For example, if a user enters 'hr@orchtech.com', it will show a success message to the user.  However, if the user enters 'name@example.com' and given that 'example.com' does not exist as an SMTP domain, it will show an error message.

You can check https://mailboxlayer.com which will show you a live demonstration.

For the 3rd party api, you may take a look at https://mailboxlayer.com/documentation, which contains detailed api requirements. So you will use this api to accomplish the task. You are free to use any framework to develop the solution. Also you can deploy it to heroku so that we can test the solution online.
